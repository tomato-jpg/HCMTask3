# HCMTask3
Code for HCM Group Research Project

Hello, 

This is the code I used for the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM) Group research project Task 3. I have included images of the main code at the appendix of the report but I thought having a git repository for the entire code and files would be better. 

I have uploaded 2 versions:
- "Kritisha_HCM_with_results" is the one that I have already used, with the output .txt files.
- "Kritisha_HCM_empty" is an empty one with the codes however, the codes are not run yet thus there are no resulting output files present.
I uploaded both versions so you could see the results that I have based my report on and so that it would be easier for you to test out the code I have made.

When opening up the notebook, the working directory should be the "src" file as the code might not work with other working directories. 

The main code is "KritisCode.ipynb" which is in the format of a Python Notebook for ease of reading and running the codes. The code calls other files throughout the notebook file such as "main.py" and "biv_plots.py" for visualisation, which were premade files given to us at the start of the project, but only "KritisCode.ipynb" needs to be run, the other files just have to be present in the src directory. 

Thank you! :)
